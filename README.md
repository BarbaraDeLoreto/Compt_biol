## Context

This repository includes the data, Rscripts and other files in relation to assessments for the Sciece Communication subject.

I chose to use the temperature logger data from Western Australia. The data was in a untidy format and had to be tiddied. I also had to produce a markdown report with two specified plots.

## The scenario

You are interested in how daily temperature fluctuations differ in sunny and shaded patches during the germination period. You want to compile and interrogate data from loggers deployed in sun-exposed and shaded sites.


## Background

The following information has been provided in the supporting materials for the assignment.

The York gum – jam woodlands of southwestern Western Australia support diverse annual understorey assemblages – probably the most diverse annual plant assemblages in Australia. In this Mediterranean-climate region it rains mostly in winter and early spring (June-October in Australia). As such, the annuals germinate in June/July, mature by September and set seed in October. The plants die after releasing seed and the populations spend the next nine months in the seed bank. The Dwyer and Mayfield labs have been working in this system for over ten years trying to understand the factors that drive variation in diversity and composition. From simple observation it is clear that different microclimatic conditions are associated with different species. In particular, sun-exposed patches support different assemblages than patches shaded by trees. One possible reason for this is that different patch types promote the germination of different species. To try and measure how these patch types vary, researchers routinely deploy temperature and relative humidity loggers called Tinytags (Gemini Data Loggers (UK) Ltd). 

## Variables
Data was collected with a weatherproof Tinytag temperature logger deployed in sunny and shaddy patches during key periods.
The variables collected were:

- Date (year-month-date)
- Min and Max temperature in Celsius
- Min and Max relative humidity 
- Min and Max dew point in Celsius
- Location (shade or sun)
- Logger: It was recorded from which logger the data was collected from (first and second)
