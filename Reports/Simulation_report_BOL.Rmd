# Report on simulation of a forest of growing trees

## Motivation for the model

The motivation for this simulation was a question that is relevant in the fields of carbon farming and landscape conservation: **how long would it take for a initial stand of trees to reach a target density value?**
Carbon farming projects that focus on vegetation methods often have specific tree densities they need to achieve [@CERGuide] [@CERAvoidedClearing]. 
In addition, from a landscape conservation perspective, a forest with more than 20 per cent canopy covers is considered to be a woodland forest [@AustraliaSOF2018] and may have more specific managements requirements and legislative protections [@QLDEucalyptWoodlands].
In addition to the main question, secondary questions were:

* If the initial stand is planted in rows, does that affect the timing of reaching the desired density?
* If the initial stand is of an even age, does that affect the timing of reaching the desired density?
* Is the model reasonable in simulating at a small (1ha) and large (25ha) scale?
* Since a key management action in certain forests is weed control to support survival of young trees, does improving survival rate by 10% affect the timing of achieving the desired density significantly?

A concise literature review was carried out on key aspects of eucalyptus biology and ecology to better establish the parameters of the model. The research identified relevant studies in the field of plant growth rate, and survival rate [@Ngugi2015] [@Tian2020] as well as dispersal [@Booth2017].  

## Description of the model

The provided individual-based model of tree growth in a forest was a great start and already included some important concepts. However, the model lacked in some elements that would make the model more realistic. In addition, for the model to be feasible given the task, some assumptions had to be made:

1. The forest is in Australia and mostly composed of eucalyptus trees (from species with similar characteristics).
2. No fire events occurred during the time period.
3. 20 per cent canopy cover is achieved with a number of trees between 150 and 200 trees per hectare.

The model was designed to take an initial forest with a certain number of trees in designated XY location and model in each time step for each tree, growth in size, aging, potential reproduction, potential death and falling of dead trees. 

Below figure 1 helps understand key elements in the model:

![Fig 1: Diagram of the model](../Images/Tree_cycle.png){width=90%}

Each tree has the following variables associated with it: 

* ID – unique identified for each tree
* Alive – condition of the tree in terms of dead or alive (if tree is alive this variable is TRUE)
* x – coordinate x for the tree location in the forest
* y – coordinate y for the tree location in the forest
* r – radius of a tree in centimetres, derived from the diameter at chest hight
* a – age of the tree. (estimate for the initial forest based on radius and mean growth rate, and then calculated in terms of time steps)
* d - number of time steps since a tree has died

The parameters used in the modelling of the forest through time are:

* maxTRees – the maximum number of trees the forest/model handles
* maxx – the maximum size of the forest in terms of x coordinate
* maxy - the maximum size of the forest in terms of y coordinate
* maxr – the maximum radius that each tree could get
* maturityr – the radius when a plant reaches maturity for reproduction
* gamma_max – top of the range for the growth rate per time step
* gamma_min – bottom of the range for growth rate per time step
* mu - mortality probability per time step for trees over 3 years
* mu_under_3 – mortality probability for plants under 3 years
* lambda - probability of producing surviving offspring after reaching maturity, per time step
* d_d – maximum dispersal distance
* min_d - minimum distance between trees
* d_f - number of time steps it takes for a dead tree to "fall"and the space be open for other trees

Key elements of this model are:

* the distinct mortality rates for young trees (a>3).
* the placement of new trees in the available space within the maximum dispersal distance from the parent tree within a certain distance from other trees.
* removal of dead trees after a few time steps.

For the placement of new trees, the model attempted to place the new tree in the available space 50 times and if that was not possible, the tree was then considered dead.

The figures below illustrate this spacial element fo the model.

Three different types of initial forests were used to understand the efficacy of the model and also any significant difference in the outcome given different planting approaches. The inital stands were:

* Initial stand of 10 trees randomly placed and with random age and radius.
* Initial stand of 10 trees planted in 2 rows, with even age and radius.
* Initial stand of 10 trees planted randomly in the space but with even age and radius.

In addition, one of the key parameters was modified, mortality of younger trees to understand how the model would behave.

Lastly, a test of the scalability of the model was carried out. For that, an area of 25 hectares was selected with an initial stand of 250 trees (10 per hectare).

## The code

Below is the code used for the simulation of an initial stand of 10 trees, randomly placed in 1 hectare and with randomly selected radius and age.

For the scenarios with the planted trees in rows and the planted trees randomly in the space, the code used to establish the initial stand is below:

```{r code planted, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

# initial forest planted in rows
planted_forest_XY <- data.frame(x = c(rep(55, 5),rep(45, 5)),
                                y = c(40, 44, 48, 52, 56, 42, 46, 50, 54, 58))
planted_forest <- data.frame(ID    = 1:nini,                        # ID for each tree 
                             alive = TRUE,                               # living or dead?
                             x     = planted_forest_XY$x,                # x position
                             y     = planted_forest_XY$y,                # y position
                             r     = 0.1,                                # radius
                             a     = 3.1,                                # age, all trees over 3yo
                             d     = 0)                                  # how long tree has been dead


# initial planted fores t random: 
planted_forest_random <- data.frame(ID    = 1:nini,                             # ID for each tree 
                        alive = TRUE,                               # living or dead?
                        x     = runif(nini, min = 0, max = p$maxx), # x position
                        y     = runif(nini, min = 0, max = p$maxy), # y position
                        r     = 0.1,                                # radius
                        a     = 3.1,                                # age, all trees over 3 yo
                        d     = 0)                   

```

The code used for the large scale simulation, only differed in the parameter related to the plot size and also the initial number of trees.

```{r code_HPC, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
tmax <- 70  # number of time steps to simulate
nini <- 250  # initial number of trees

# establish the list of parameters
p$maxx <- 500          # x-size of forest in meters (equals a hectare)
p$maxy <- 500      
```

## Results

In terms of density, the random initial forest achieved density slightly earlier than the planted ones. However, to understand if this difference is significant, further studies with a relevant number of replicates would need to be designed.  

Nonetheless, in all scenarios it took 50 years or more for the desired density to be achieved. That is relevant from a management perspective as over 50 years is a long time to sustain management activities but also because of some carbon farming methodologies have a designated period of only 25 years where trees have to remain uncleared for carbon credits to be generated and registered.

The graph below shows the number of tress through time for the three scenarios.

![Fig 4: Density 3 scenarios](../Plots/Desity3models.jpg)



Another interesting result relates to the dispersion of new trees. The dispersal occurred in a way that after more than 50 time steps the distribution of trees was visually homogeneous across the space. That is relevant too as in terms of landscape conservation, outcomes can be potentialised this way.

In relation to improving survival rate by 10%, that has affected the timing of achieving the desired density by order of 10 years.

The model also behaved similarly when using a large scale plot of 25 hectares with 10 trees per hectare.

## Conclusion

From the modeled results it is possible to conclude that the model scale and the planting approach does not affect the achievement of the desired density.

It is also concluded that regardless of the initial scenario, the density was achieved only after 50 years.

When survival rate of young trees was improved by 10%, the density was achieved in around 40 years. That indicates that management activities that support the survival of younger tree may have a significant impact in achieving the desired density for a certain area.
